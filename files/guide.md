# CAREER GUIDE
# ONE DAY AT A TIME

## MACHINE LEARNING.
⦁   LEARN THROUGH SPACED ``REPETITION`` AND ACTIVE ``RECALL``.
⦁   ``ITERATIVELY WORK ON SAME AND SIMILAR PROJECTS`` WITH LESS AND LESS HELP.
⦁   ``COME BACK`` TO OLD PROJECTS ``AFTER COMPLETING NEXT TOPIC.``
⦁    ATTEMPT ``ORIGINAL CAPSTONE PROJECTS`` AT THE END.

# ROADMAP

⦁   HTML, CSS.

# PROBLEM SOLVING

##  Understand.

⦁	Define the problem thoroughly.
⦁	Study the examples carefully.
⦁	Re-read the problem.
⦁	Identify inputs, outputs, flow, edge cases and contsraints.
⦁	Ask clarifying questions.
⦁	Come up with examples and tests and work through them manually.
⦁	Take note of key information, patterns, ideas and edge cases.

##  Plan.

⦁	Formulate a basic approach first with a focus on correctness.
⦁	Come up with a working naive solution, either the idea, psuedocode or fully developed.
⦁	Evaluate your naive solution and try to optimize it step-by-step.
⦁	Look for patterns that you can map to categories and tools, techniques, data structures and algorithms to optimize.
⦁	Consider multiple approaches and the trade offs in performance and readability
⦁	Analyze the time and space complexity of each approach and pick an optimal solution.

##  Execute.

⦁	Follow pseudocode for step-by-step logic and solve problem.
⦁	Walk through with examples and testcases to validate logic.
⦁	Write clean code with helper functions if needed.
⦁	Debug as needed, refactor and try other approaches comparing accuracy and complexity.
⦁	Attemp similar problems.

##  Reflect.

⦁	If solution failed note unfamiliar concepts and shortcomings.
⦁	Look into background material.
⦁	Plan to revisit problem and attempt similar easier problems.
⦁	Look up solutions and study them
